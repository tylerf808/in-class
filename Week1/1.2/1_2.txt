- WEb dev is collaborative
- Version control helps manage a single codebase with multi devs
- Git provides a process for resolving conflicts and version histories
- Branch is a copy of the codebase
- Main branch is the "base of the tree"
    - Git lab still uses master branch terminology
- Push uploads code changes into the main branch
- Rule of thumb: Pull first, and then push your changes
    - ensures any changes made while working on code is in your branch
        before you push
- Pull brings the community code and copies it to your computer
- Conflicts occur on the Pull
- GitHub allows for a "pull request"
- README files are an explanation of the repository
- Basic git commands: git clone, git add, git commit,
    git push, git pull, git status
- Make sure to be in repository folder before entering
    git commands
- git add -A adds files to get ready to be commited
    - Adds them to the packages that itself will be commited
- git push origin main would push changes to main branch; origin specifies
    which branch you're pushing too 

HTML Syntax
- opening tags and closing tags with content in between
- Tags can have attributes
- Self-closing tags don't need a closing tag (example: img tag)
- Containers
    - <html> wraps entire page 
    - <head> wraps the header of the page
    - <body> wraps the main content
    - <div> logical container
    - <p> wraps individual paragraphs
- HTML forms take input/interaction from the user
    - <form>
    - <input>
    - <label>
    - <button> button
    - <textarea> large text box

CSS
- Cascading Style Sheets
- Modify attributes of all your tags in a different file
- Works by hooking onto a selector added into HTML using classes and 
    identifiers
- define class with .className
- padding effects within the div box, margin effects outside the div box
